# Supabase MCP Server

> Connect your Supabase projects to Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, and other AI assistants.

![supabase-mcp-demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fce101a-b7d4-482f-9182-0be70ed1ad56)

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) standardizes how Large Language Models (LLMs) talk to external services like Supabase. It connects AI assistants directly with your Supabase project and allows them to perform tasks like managing tables, fetching config, and querying data. See the [full list of tools](#tools).

## Prerequisites

You will need Node.js installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

```shell
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

### 1. Personal access token (PAT)

First, go to your [Supabase settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) and create a personal access token. Give it a name that describes its purpose, like "Cursor MCP Server".

This will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your Supabase account. Make sure to copy the token, as you won't be able to see it again.

### 2. Configure MCP client

Next, configure your MCP client (such as Cursor) to use this server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--access-token",
        "<personal-access-token>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<personal-access-token>` with the token you created in step 1. Alternatively you can omit `--access-token` and instead set the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to your personal access token (you will need to restart your MCP client after setting this). This allows you to keep your token out of version control if you plan on committing this configuration to a repository.

The following additional options are available:

- `--project-ref`: Used to scope the server to a specific project. See [project scoped mode](#project-scoped-mode).
- `--read-only`: Used to restrict the server to read-only queries. See [read-only mode](#read-only-mode).

If you are on Windows, you will need to [prefix the command](#windows). If your MCP client doesn't accept JSON, the direct CLI command is:

```shell
npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --access-token=<personal-access-token>
```

> Note: Do not run this command directly - this is meant to be executed by your MCP client in order to start the server. `npx` automatically downloads the latest version of the MCP server from `npm` and runs it in a single command.

#### Windows

On Windows, you will need to prefix the command with `cmd /c`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--access-token",
        "<personal-access-token>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

or with `wsl` if you are running Node.js inside WSL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--access-token",
        "<personal-access-token>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure Node.js is available in your system `PATH` environment variable. If you are running Node.js natively on Windows, you can set this by running the following commands in your terminal.

1. Get the path to `npm`:

   ```shell
   npm config get prefix
   ```

2. Add the directory to your PATH:

   ```shell
   setx PATH "%PATH%;<path-to-dir>"
   ```

3. Restart your MCP client.

### Project scoped mode

By default, the MCP server will have access to all organizations and projects in your Supabase account. If you want to restrict the server to a specific project, you can set the `--project-ref` flag on the CLI command:

```shell
npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --access-token=<personal-access-token> --project-ref=<project-ref>
```

Replace `<project-ref>` with the ID of your project. You can find this under **Project ID** in your Supabase [project settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/general).

After scoping the server to a project, [account-level](#project-management) tools like `list_projects` and `list_organizations` will no longer be available. The server will only have access to the specified project and its resources.

### Read-only mode

If you wish to restrict the Supabase MCP server to read-only queries, set the `--read-only` flag on the CLI command:

```shell
npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --access-token=<personal-access-token> --read-only
```

This prevents write operations on any of your databases by executing SQL as a read-only Postgres user. Note that this flag only applies to database tools (`execute_sql` and `apply_migration`) and not to other tools like `create_project` or `create_branch`.

## Tools

_**Note:** This server is pre-1.0, so expect some breaking changes between versions. Since LLMs will automatically adapt to the tools available, this shouldn't affect most users._

The following Supabase tools are available to the LLM:

#### Project Management

_**Note:** these tools will be unavailable if the server is [scoped to a project](#project-scoped-mode)._

- `list_projects`: Lists all Supabase projects for the user.
- `get_project`: Gets details for a project.
- `create_project`: Creates a new Supabase project.
- `pause_project`: Pauses a project.
- `restore_project`: Restores a project.
- `list_organizations`: Lists all organizations that the user is a member of.
- `get_organization`: Gets details for an organization.

#### Database Operations

- `list_tables`: Lists all tables within the specified schemas.
- `list_extensions`: Lists all extensions in the database.
- `list_migrations`: Lists all migrations in the database.
- `apply_migration`: Applies a SQL migration to the database. SQL passed to this tool will be tracked within the database, so LLMs should use this for DDL operations (schema changes).
- `execute_sql`: Executes raw SQL in the database. LLMs should use this for regular queries that don't change the schema.
- `get_logs`: Gets logs for a Supabase project by service type (api, postgres, edge functions, auth, storage, realtime). LLMs can use this to help with debugging and monitoring service performance.
- `get_advisors`: Gets a list of advisory notices for a Supabase project. LLMs can use this to check for security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

#### Edge Function Management

- `list_edge_functions`: Lists all Edge Functions in a Supabase project.
- `deploy_edge_function`: Deploys a new Edge Function to a Supabase project. LLMs can use this to deploy new functions or update existing ones.

#### Project Configuration

- `get_project_url`: Gets the API URL for a project.
- `get_anon_key`: Gets the anonymous API key for a project.

#### Branching (Experimental, requires a paid plan)

- `create_branch`: Creates a development branch with migrations from production branch.
- `list_branches`: Lists all development branches.
- `delete_branch`: Deletes a development branch.
- `merge_branch`: Merges migrations and edge functions from a development branch to production.
- `reset_branch`: Resets migrations of a development branch to a prior version.
- `rebase_branch`: Rebases development branch on production to handle migration drift.

#### Development Tools

- `search_docs`: Searches the Supabase documentation for up-to-date information. LLMs can use this to find answers to questions or learn how to use specific features.
- `generate_typescript_types`: Generates TypeScript types based on the database schema. LLMs can save this to a file and use it in their code.

#### Cost Confirmation

- `get_cost`: Gets the cost of a new project or branch for an organization.
- `confirm_cost`: Confirms the user's understanding of new project or branch costs. This is required to create a new project or branch.
