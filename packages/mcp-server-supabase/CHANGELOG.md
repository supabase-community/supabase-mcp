# Changelog

All notable changes to the Supabase MCP Server will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added - Database Backup & Recovery Tools
- **New MCP Tools**
  - `undo_database_restore` - Reverts database to pre-restoration state (destructive operation)
  - `list_restore_points` - Lists available point-in-time recovery (PITR) restore points
  - `create_restore_point` - Creates manual database backup/restore point

- **Platform Updates**
  - Implemented complete `BackupOperations` interface with 7 backup-related methods
  - Added restore point management API integration
  - Full point-in-time recovery (PITR) support
  - Defensive coding for varying API response structures

### Added - Domain & Database Configuration Tools
- **New MCP Tools**
  - `get_postgrest_config` - Retrieves PostgREST service configuration
  - `update_postgrest_config` - Updates PostgREST max_rows, db_schema, and other settings
  - `get_pgsodium_config` - Retrieves pgsodium encryption configuration
  - `update_pgsodium_config` - Updates pgsodium encryption keys (destructive - can break existing encrypted data)

- **Platform Updates**
  - Implemented complete `CustomDomainOperations` interface with 11 domain management methods:
    - Custom hostname management (create, activate, verify, delete)
    - Vanity subdomain management (create, check availability, activate, delete)
    - DNS configuration and verification support
  - Implemented complete `DatabaseConfigOperations` interface with 13 configuration methods:
    - PostgreSQL configuration (GET/PUT)
    - Connection pooler (pgbouncer/supavisor) configuration
    - PostgREST configuration
    - pgsodium encryption configuration
    - Database webhooks enablement
    - Read replica management
  - All 11 domain tools in `domain-tools.ts` now fully functional with platform backing
  - Added pgsodium configuration methods to platform interface

- **Notes**
  - Domain tools were previously defined but not wired to the platform - now fully operational
  - Some interface methods (`configurePitr`, `managePgSodium`) throw errors as Management API lacks dedicated endpoints
  - Read replica setup/removal uses dedicated `/setup` and `/remove` endpoints

### Added - SQL Snippets Management Tools
- **New MCP Tools**
  - `list_sql_snippets` - Lists all SQL snippets for the logged-in user, with optional project filtering
  - `get_sql_snippet` - Retrieves a specific SQL snippet by ID with full content and metadata

- **Features**
  - Read-only access to user's SQL snippets created in Supabase Studio
  - Optional project-based filtering for snippet listing
  - Detailed snippet information including:
    - SQL content and schema version
    - Snippet metadata (name, description, visibility, favorite status)
    - Project and user associations (owner, last updated by)
    - Timestamps (created, updated)
  - Response size limiting for large snippet lists (max 100 snippets)

- **Notes**
  - Snippets are managed through Supabase Studio UI
  - Management API provides read-only access only (no create/update/delete operations)
  - Tools are part of the 'database' feature group

- **Runtime Mode Management (Claude CLI Optimized)**
  - Interactive read-only/write mode toggling with confirmations
  - Claude CLI-specific status indicators (ðŸ”’ read-only, ðŸ”“ write mode)
  - Security validation and warnings for destructive operations
  - Real-time mode status monitoring and guidance

- **Interactive Project Switching**
  - Multi-project detection and formatted project lists for Claude CLI
  - Interactive project selection by ID or name
  - Project status indicators and detailed information display
  - Seamless runtime project switching with validation

- **New Runtime Tools Feature Group**
  - `toggle_read_only_mode`: Interactive mode switching with confirmations
  - `get_runtime_mode_status`: Current mode status with security info
  - `set_read_only_mode`: Explicit mode setting with validation
  - `validate_mode_change`: Pre-validation of mode change requirements
  - `switch_project`: Interactive project switching for multi-project setups
  - `get_current_project`: Current project details and status
  - `list_projects`: All available projects with Claude CLI formatting

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - Config file parser tests with various input scenarios
  - Mode manager tests covering all Claude CLI interactions
  - Enhanced authentication tests for config file integration
  - Token resolution tests with multiple source priorities

### Changed
